## What is API Security Documentation

Security is a key consideration in API deployment, it also technically difficult and can be hard to document. It should:

* Be a clear, concise, and provide a brief introduction for developers with limited security experience
* Provide step-by-step procedures. (A set of numbered steps.)
* Explain how to set up security in the development, test and production/deployment environments. These may be different.
* Describe the easiest way to use the API with the correct security setup.

## Security Topics

### Overview

1. Security approach and choices made.

    e.g. TLS 1.2 and above.

2. Consequences and justification

### Prerequisites

* Where to get tokens or API keys if needed
* How to generate Self signed PKI certificates if needed

### The Main Body Should Follow These Guidelines.

* Set up. For example: setup an API key in an http header; install a self signed certificate etc
* How to make API calls with the correct security enabled
* How to verify that security is functioning correctly
* Security error messages and what they mean
